st.markdown("# Contributions")

# Open source contributions (links to PRs, commits, issues)

# Community involvement (technical blogs, talks, meetups)

# Hackathons, coding challenges, or competitions

# Any volunteer technical work (non-profits, student orgs, etc.)

# Mentioning game beta tests might be fun

# If there is a way to list all the repos I have contributed to where the owner is not me, would be great
